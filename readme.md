## About
This is a extension for Safari to help monitor your torrent downloads at the great service that is <http://put.io>

## How can you help?
Well, I built out the part that I wanted most, being able to monitor downloads. You can help by providing feedback and ideas, or if you're the more technical kind, I'd love you to jump in the code and add some stuff yourself.

## Updates 
###### 1.2 - 02-18-2012
+ When no downloads are present you can now click on "No Active Downloads" and it will open <http://put.io>
+ When a file is downloading you can click on it and will open a link to the transfer page
+ When a file has completed downloading (seeding) clicking on it will bring you to the files page on <http://put.io>
