## About
This is a extension for Safari to help monitor your torrent downloads at the great service that is http://put.io

## How can you help?
Well, I built out the part that I wanted most, being able to monitor downloads. You can help by providing feedback and ideas, or if you're the more technical kind, I'd love you to jump in the code and add some stuff yourself.
